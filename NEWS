Changes on 1.0.2 since 1.0.1:

* Added 'no_usb_trash' option into config file, defaulted to 0, which
    defines whether skip trashing files on removable media or not. If
    defined to skip then files will go into "trash-unsupported" and user
    will be asked by fm_file_ops_job_run_with_progress() to remove them
    instead.

* Added 'no_child_non_expandable' option into config file, defaulted to
    0, which adds feature to hide expanders on non-expandable rows so no
    extra 'No Sub Folder' rows are shown. No automation on that is done
    still since it may be expensive sometimes.

* Corrected underscores (mnemonics) on every menu and dialog.


Changes on 1.0.1 since 1.0.0:

* Fixed slowness on loading and changing of very large folders.

* FmFolderView is converted into generic interface. Former FmFolderView
    is renamed into FmStandardView so APIs specific to it have changed
    their names and arguments. Old APIs left for compatibility reasons.
    New FmFolderView interface now contains methods to handle popups,
    keyboard and mouse gestures, including Cut/Copy/Paste operations.

* Fixed compatibility with systems that are a bit old so have neither
    decent Vala compiler nor GLib 2.26.

* Few lesser bugfixes.
