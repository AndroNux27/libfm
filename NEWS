Changes on 1.0.1 since 1.0.0:

* Fixed slowness on loading and changing of very large folders.

* FmFolderView is converted into generic interface. Former FmFolderView
    is renamed into FmFolderExoView so APIs specific to it have changed
    their names and arguments. Old APIs left for compatibility reasons.
    New FmFolderView interface now contains methods to handle popups,
    keyboard and mouse gestures, including Cut/Copy/Paste operations.

* Fixed compatibility with systems that are a bit old so have neither
    decent Vala compiler nor GLib 2.26.

* Few lesser bugfixes.
